After the quick analysis of the data sets, it shows the grade division according to interest rate is
A-less than 8% interest rate
B-more than 9% interest rate
C-more than 13% interest rate 
D-more than 16% interest rate
E-more than 18% interest rate
F-more than 21% interest rate

Similarly, many other insights can be obtained from the data. The classification of data and logistic regression needs to be computed to find the relations between the attributes of the data. Due to the time restriction I could not perform them. However a simple plot is attached here in doc.
